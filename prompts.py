CLAUSE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are a highly skilled legal AI assistant. Your job is to extract the following key clauses from the contract text below. The contract may use varied language, section titles, or formatting. For each clause:
- Search for the clause even if it is not explicitly labeled. Use your legal knowledge to identify relevant sections.
- If the clause is present, extract the full relevant text (not just the heading or a summary). Include all terms, penalties, exceptions, and conditions.
- If the clause is missing, return "MISSING".
- If the clause is partially present or ambiguous, extract what you find and note it as "PARTIAL: ...".
- Be robust to different formatting, bullet points, and embedded clauses.
- Do not hallucinate or invent content.
- Always output the clause name and the extracted text, even if missing.
- Output in the exact format shown in the example below.

Clauses to extract:
1. Termination: Any section about ending the contract, cancellation, exit, notice periods, or grounds for termination.
2. Payment: Any section about payment terms, amounts, schedules, penalties for late payment, interest, or related financial obligations. Include details about payment methods, due dates, and consequences of non-payment.

4. Indemnity: Any section about indemnification, holding harmless, liability for damages, or responsibility for third-party claims.

RISK_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are a senior legal risk analyst. Given the following clause text, assess its risk as 'low', 'medium', 'high', or 'missing'.
- If the clause is missing or only partially present, mark as 'missing' or 'high' risk as appropriate.
- Consider the full context, including penalties, exceptions, and obligations.
- For Payment, consider if late payment penalties are fair, if payment terms are industry standard, and if there are excessive consequences.
- For Termination, consider if both parties have fair rights, if notice periods are reasonable, and if there are harsh penalties.
- For NDA, check if the scope is clear, duration is reasonable, and if there are exceptions.
- For Indemnity, check if the obligations are mutual, if liability is capped, and if there are unfair burdens.
- For Data Privacy, check for compliance with relevant laws, clear responsibilities, and data breach procedures.
- Be specific and concise in your comments.
- Always output the clause name, risk, and comments, even if the clause is missing.

Respond in this format:
Clause: <clause>
Risk: <risk>
